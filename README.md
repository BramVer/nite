NITE, the Nigh Impervious Task Executor
=======================================

##About

NITE - the Nigh Impervious Task Executor - is a modular, event-driven remote
task execution framework written in Python. It aims to provide developers and
sysadmins alike with a base platform they can easily extend, allowing for fast
and stable implementations of task queues, batch processors and the like.

The name is also incredibly cool.
It should be mentioned that this project is being worked on purely for the sake
of hacking up something neat, and that it will probably not live up to your
standards.
